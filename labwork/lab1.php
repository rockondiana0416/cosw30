        <h1>I'm So Excited About PHP!!!</h1>
        <p>Hi! My name is Diana. I'm really excited about taking this class but, 
        also a little nervous. I really want to do well. I've already met some of my classmates when 
        we were in class on Wednesday. I had to make sure I got some phone numbers. Mainly this summer 
        my favorite thing to do was sit by the pool.</p>
        
        <p>This is the link to my <a href="\\https://github.com/rockondiana0416/cosw30\\">Github</a> account.
        I'm sure we will be doing some great stuff so let's fill it up!!!</p>

            <p>This assignment hasn't been to bad. I decided to start this in <a href='https://codepen.io/rockondiana/pen/yLBoWYK?editors=1100'>CodePen</a> 
            and, then copy it into my AWS Classroom. I wanted to see how the page would render. I like to see how my coding looks like while doing it. It seems 
            like I have to put my code through Github before I can see it. And why is my ?> showing up on the screen below? Also, when I put a semicolon after my paragragh closing tag that shows up too. </p>";
